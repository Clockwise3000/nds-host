# NDS-Host!
This is a repository that is a backup of all of the NDS Roms on the main GBA project. This currently includes: Nintendo DS games (crazy right?). 

# Creating a Fork!
Unless you have extensive knowledge of self hosting runners, you probably don't wanna try and use this repo for deploying
## Once Deployed!
Once deployed, make sure the site is live by visiting index.html. In this case, our link is https://cattn.github.io/nds-host/index.html, but replace `cattn` with your username, and `nds-host` with the repo name, if changed. 

## Link to the roms!
If you saw a page load, good job! Everything is successful so far. Now you can start linking. Following instructions from [here](https://github.com/Cattn/gba/blob/gh-pages/docs/UltimateGuide.md) link the games. Make sure to link properly, links from here are Case Sensitive! For example: `https://cattn.github.io/nds-host/nds-alt/Dragon_Quest_Heroes_-_Rocket_Slime_(USA).zip` is the proper way to link Rocket Slime. Notice how the first letters of words are capitalized, and the file extension is also included (It is `.zip`. Remember to look at the entire file name and path.). 

# Notes!
Please note that this may take a long time to deploy. Like a really long time. This is 1700 NDS Roms. 
If you choose to clone this repository locally for any reason, please note that the roms will take up about 76GBs of local storage (Roms themselves are 38GB).

If you wish to help contribute, feel free to make a pull request! Try not to modify the folders included, as we may reject any additions not organized into a folder. As long as you create a new folder on the root, or create a folder inside the existing ones, we will happily take contributions!
